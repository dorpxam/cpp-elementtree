cpp-ElementTree
---------------

This libxml2 wrapper is intended as a small experiment in C++ interface design
and various tricks relating to C++11, while still being useful.

It attempts to closely mimic the lxml Python library's <a
href="http://lxml.de/tutorial.html">ElementTree</a> interface and all the perks
that entails (e.g. uniform namespace and text handling), while making use of
some modern C++ design ideas, such as automatic memory and ownership
management. It is intended to work *without surprises*, in other words all
libxml2 management quirks should be hidden.

When built with a C++11 compiler, uniform initializer lists may be used in
various places to specify attribute lists:

    using etree::Element;
    using etree::SubElement;
    
    Element make_status_msg()
    {
        Element msg("status", {
            {"first-attribute",          "first-value"},
            {"{urn:some-namepace}attr2", "second-value"}
        });
        SubElement(msg, "system-load").text = get_system_load();
        return msg;
    }

The ``etree::feed`` namespace includes an incomplete RSS/ATOM feed
parser/generator. It is a work in progress, but can already parse some basic
pieces.

Partially useful API docs can be found here:

 * <a href="http://dw.github.com/cpp-elementtree/namespaceetree.html">etree namespace</A>
 * <a href="http://dw.github.com/cpp-elementtree/namespaceetreefeed.html">etree::feed namespace</a>


### Text handing

All text passed to or from the API is assumed to be in UTF-8 format. Text
returned by the API is in UTF-8 format wrapped in a std::string.


### Thread safety

The library and underlying libxml2 implementation are thread safe in that
determistic behavior is guaranteed only so long as library objects objects
aren't shared among threads. This is due to the library internally performing
unlocked reference counting using the underlying libxml2 DOM structures.

It is only possible to achieve thread safe behaviour if a single thread at a
time is considered owner for all live objects referencing a given document. For
a thread to pass anÂ object to another thread, it must relinquish all remaining
references it holds on that document beforehand.


### Building

cpp-ElementTree consists of two files: ``element.hpp`` and ``element.cpp``. The
implementation file must be linked against libxml2 somehow during the build.

The ``etree::feed`` implementation relies on various POSIX-related time parsing
functions that aren't found on Windows. In order to avoid a large external
dependency (e.g. Boost), ``etree::feed`` is UNIX-only for the time being.


### Horrors

 * Given the option of repeatedly heap-allocating potentially very short-lived
   proxy objects, or casting a ``void *`` for use as an integer, the latter
   path was chosen. ``ref()`` and ``unref()`` in ``element.cpp`` are suitably
   readable as a result.

 * The Nullable implementation currently uses placement-new for the purposes of
   entertainment. The resulting object is most probably misaligned, and buggy
   in other ways yet unknown. The ``char[]`` buffer should be replaced with a
   typed member variable.
